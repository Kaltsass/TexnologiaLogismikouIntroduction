This is a simple Gradle project created for my university course. It demonstrates the basic setup and execution of a Gradle-based Java project, including unit testing.


# Creation of my first simple gradle project.

# Made the jar file executable as an attribute.

# Uploading it for my Uni-Class as a proof of work.
# Note: There is one test case commented out that, if uncommented, demonstrates a failure scenario.
